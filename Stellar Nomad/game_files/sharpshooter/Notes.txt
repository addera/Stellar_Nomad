Notes:

todo:
important:
	colision system:
		reworking colision system {help?}
		check for blocks under bottom right, bottom left, and anything in between, same for top and sides.
		place soldier on block if player has fallen into block.
	wepon firing proper direction [how to display wepons, independent?]
	rework keys to prevent right/left canceling out bug

future ideas to implement:
	roaming class in Solder for different types of roaming solders
	use differnet image for running, jumping, standing. investigate current animation. [need animation and images from randy] {use gifs?}
	fine tune map storage, block size? [ask about possable block types]
	background tiles [block size depends on scale, randy]
	configuring HUD [randy required]
	coin drops by enemy
	colectable perks, simaler to previus gun pickup
	enemy types: crawling, flying, walking
